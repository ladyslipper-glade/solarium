\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

The dynamics of solar systems is an interesting research topic in astronomy. Although many solar
systems exhibit a high degree of stability even over billions of years, that is not universally
the case. When a large number of bodies interact gravitationally, chaotic behavior can arise
causing planets to be ejected from the system or even to collide. There is evidence that this
sort of chaos even occured in our own solar system early in its history\footnote{It is currently
  believed that a mars sized planet collided with the Earth causing the formation of the Moon.}

The purpose of this exercise is to simulate the motion of objects in a solar system. The
simulation is intended to run for millions (or even billions) of simulated years to explore long
term solar system stability. We will assume that a solar system is composed of a finite number
of gravitationally interacting ``point'' masses. We will also consider each object to be a
sphere with a fixed size so that collisions can be detected and counted.

This model of the solar system is reasonably accurate for our purposes. The effects of
interplanteary gas and dust as well as exotic ``dark matter'' or ``dark energy'' should not be
significant on the scales of interest here. In this model the motion of the objects in the solar
system can be completely described by the reponse to their mutual gravitational attraction.

Although it is hoped that the program described here will produce reasonable and interesting
results, the primary goal of this exercise is to demonstrate various parallel programming
techniques in the context of a typical high performance computing application.

The rest of this document is organized as follows. Section~\ref{sec:computation} describes the
required computation in more detail along with some mathematical background.
Section~\ref{sec:preliminaries} discusses some preliminary matters such as what system of units
should be used and how the input and output of the computation should be prepared and handled. A
sequential program that solves the problem is presented and discussed in detail in
Section~\ref{sec:sequential}. Various issues surrounding how to parallelize the computation,
along with related programming exercises are then presented in Section~\ref{sec:parallelizing}.
Finally the document concludes with some benchmarks, a summary of results, and so forth.
